EXERCISE

-> Create 2 likely email addresses for 50 senior execs

Here is a dirty list. This list has many problems

You need to create 2 likely email addresses for 50 execs. You’ll need to filter the list so it’s only senior execs. Make sure the emails actually might work. Etc.

You need to do all the work from within an IDE (Cursor, etc)

And you need to show or explain the process on Loom

the list
the Loom video

HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL

The list you create needs to be maximally good and accurate

And everything you do needs to be done in a high quality and professional way where you pay attention to detail

Your video needs to show or explain your entire process. Here’s a really good example

You can use AI as much as you want. Or not at all. As long as the final output is of maximal quality
Process:
Steps:
Preprocessing:
1. Read the raw.csv file
2. Feature Engineering: Make the proper features inorder to make useful predictions later along the line
3. Structuring data properly
4. Removing duplicates
5. Removing empty fields
Output now is the first subtask of the assignment:"You’ll need to filter the list so it’s only senior execs" is done and stored in candidates.csv file
Going forward with the second subtask:
 "Create 2 likely email addresses for 50 execs"
I have two approaches on the basis of two assumptions of the statement:"You need to do all the work from within an IDE"
Assuming it meant that I cant leave the IDE at all then I have final_list_top_50.csv file as my answer which I explained in the Loom video.
Assuming it meant that I have to show all my work but can you resources from outside..I have my second approach here
